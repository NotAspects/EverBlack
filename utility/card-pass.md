# ðŸ’³ Card \[Pass]

![](../.gitbook/assets/evercard.gif)

## Information

We have implemented NFTs in the form of `Access Cards` for the first generation of Everblack. Your cards will be fully customizable in the coming days after reveal. Later you will be able to change your `Name`. But the `ID` will be randomly generated for you, which will also give you access to the panel and the different features. The `Status` of your card will be activated once you have stacked your NFT for a certain amount of time. The `Security` features will be available later too. Keep an eye on your NFT once minted because some of them might have some updates later on !
