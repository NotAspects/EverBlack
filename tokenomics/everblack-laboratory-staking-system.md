# ðŸ“™ EverBlack Laboratory \[Staking System]

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** The EverBlack Laboratory is the first staking system, it is the first way of earning $USB. The system will first put your NFT within a smart contract on the Solana blockchain. In exchange for your staking (locking your asset) you will be rewarded with our utility tokens. The locking period of your asset will occur for a certain amount of time depending on the rarity of your NFT and the amount of time you lock it in. It should be noted that the longer you bet, the higher the rate of return.

## Staking formula&#x20;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/output-onlinegiftools (3) (1).gif>)

```
Yield = Rarity * Schedule * Lock Period * World
```

### Stacked rate of return

| World       | Schedule | Rarity    | Token / Day |
| ----------- | -------- | --------- | ----------- |
| Level 1 (ï¿½) | 5 days   | 1 - 4000  | 2 $USB      |
| Level 2 (ï¿½) | 10 days  | 1 - 2987  | 5 $USB      |
| Level 3 (ï¿½) | 15 days  | 1 - 1578  | 8 $USB      |
| Level 4 (ï¿½) | 20 days  | 1 - 975   | 10 $USB     |

## Burn System

To allow the rarity of **$USB** to rise and to combat inflation, every time you use **$USB** in the EverBlack ecosystem, it will be burned. This means that the token is gone forever and can never be used again. In theory, this concept of constantly earning and burning helps maintain an adequate circulating supply.

## Halving System

To keep our token rare and limit the inflation of our token, a Halving system will be established every 2 months, which will reduce the Stacking rewards by half. By reducing issuance over time and having a maximum supply cap, we will limit inflation.
